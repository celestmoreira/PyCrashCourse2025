# Python Crash Course: Learning Journey

This is my personal repo for following along with *Python Crash Course (2nd Edition)* by Eric Matthes.

## Folders
- `exercises/` — Practice problems
- `notes/` — My chapter notes
- `projects/` — Bigger projects from the book

## Goal
Learn Python by doing. One chapter at a time.

## How to Read the Files

Each exercise file follows this pattern:

**Examples:**

| File Name | Meaning |
|------------|----------|
| `ex01_01.py` | Chapter 1, Exercise 1 |
| `ex02_05.py` | Chapter 2, Exercise 5 |
| `ex07_10.py` | Chapter 7, Exercise 10 |

**Notes files** follow a similar pattern:

| File Name | Meaning |
|------------|----------|
| `ch01.md` | Notes for Chapter 1 |
| `ch02.md` | Notes for Chapter 2 |
