# Chapter 3: Introducing Lists 

This chapter taught me how to work with **lists**, one of Python's most useful tools for sorting and organizing groups of information.
Lists are dynamic, flexible, and show up everywhere in programming.

## What is a list? 

A **list** is a **collection of items in a particular order.**

You make a list using **square brackets `[]`**, and seperate items with **commas**: 
```python
bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
```
Even though the items are grouped together, they don't have to be related in any way.

Lists can hold numbers, strings, or even a mix of both.
> Tip: Name your lists in **plural form**, like `names`, `cars`, or `bicycles`. 

---

## Accessing Elements in a List

Each item in a list has a **position number** called an **index.**
In python, **index numbers start at 0 not 1!**
```python
bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
print(bicycles[0]) # 'trek'
print(bicycles[3]) # 'specialized'
```
You can also count backwards using **negative indexes**:
```python
print(bicycle[-1]) # 'specialized' (the last item)
```

--- 

## Using List Items 

You can use items from a list just like variables. 

For example, combine them with an f-string: 
```python
bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
message = f"My first bicycle was a {bicycle[0].title().}"
print(message)

# Output: My first bicycle was a Trek. 
```
And since list items are strings, you can use **string methods** like `.title()`, `.upper()`, or `.lower()` directly on them.

---

## Index Positions Start at 0 (not 1)

It's easy to make a mistake called an **index error** when you ask for an item that doesn't exist. 
```python 
motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
print(motorcycles[3])
# Output: IndexError: list index out of range
```
This happens because there's no item at index 3, the last one is at index 2.

If that ever happens, print your list or use `len(list_name)` to check how many times it has. 

---

## Modifying, Adding, and Removing Elements 

Lists are **dynamic**, meaning you can change them anytime.

### Changing an Item 
```python 
motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
motorcycles[0] = 'ducati' 
print(motorcycles)
# ['ducati', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
```
---

## Adding Items 

### 1. Append to the end 
```python 
motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
motorcycles.append('ducati')
print(motorcycles)
#  ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki', 'ducati']
```
### 2. Start with an empty list 
```python
motorcycles = []
motorcycles.append('honda')
motorcycles.append('yamaha')
motorcycles.append('suzuki')
print(motorcycles)
#  ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
```
### 3. Insert at a specific position 
```python
motorcycles.insert(0, 'ducati')
print(motorcycles)
# ['ducati', 'honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
```

---

## Removing Items 
### 1. Remove by position using `del`
```python
motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
del motorcycles[0]
print(motorcycles)
# ['yamaha', 'suzuki']
```
### 2. Remove and keep the value using `.pop()` 
```python 
motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
popped_motorcycle = motorcycle.pop()
print(popped_motorcycle)
# suzuki
```
Pop removes the last item by default, but you can remove from anywhere: 
```python 
first_owned = motorcycles.pop(0)
```
### 3. Remove by value using `.remove()`
```python
motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki', 'ducati']
motorcycles.remove('ducati')
print(motorcycles)
# ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
```
You can even store the removed value to use in a message: 
```python 
too_expensive = 'ducati'
motorcycles.remove(too_expensive)
print(f"\nA {too_expensive.title()} is too expensive for me.")
```

---

## When to use which 
- `del` when you don't need the item anymore (does not keep the value)
- `pop()` when you want to use the value later (keeps the value)
- `remove()` when you know the item's value, not its index (keeps the value)

---

## Organizing Lists 

### 1. Sorting List Permanently
Use `.sort()` to change the order alphabetically forever.
```python
cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']
cars.sort()
print(cars)
# ['audi', 'bmw', 'subaru', 'toyota']
```
Add `reverse=true` to sort in **reverse aplphabetical order**: 
```python
cars.sort(reverse=True)
```
### 2. Sorting a List Temporarily 
Use the `sorted(list_name)` function when you want to show a list in order **without changing it permanently**.

### 3. Reversing a List 
Use `.reverse()` to flip the order of a list:
```python
cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']
cars.reverse()
print(cars)
# ['subaru', 'toyota', 'audi', 'bmw']
```
The `.reverse()` method changes the list **permanently**, but calling it again will flip it back to the original order. 

### 4. Finding the Length of a List 
You can quickly check how many items are in a list using: 
```python 
cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']
print(len(cars))  # 4
```
