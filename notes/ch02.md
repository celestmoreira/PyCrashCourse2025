# Chapter 2: Variables & Simple Data Types 

This chapter taught me the building blocks of python like how to store data, use text, and make programs easier to read. 

## Python Files & Syntax Highlighting 

- Files that end with `.py` are Python programs. 
- When you run them, the **Python interpreter** reads each line and executes it.
- Most python interpreters colors different parts of your code, this is called **syntax highlighting**, and it helps you spot errors faster.

---

## Variables: Storing Information 
- A **variable** is like a label you stick on a piece of information so you can reuse it later. 

```python
message = "Hello, Python world!" 
print(message)
```
Here, `message` is the variable and `"Hello, Python world!"` is the value stored inside it. 

- You can change the value anytime. Think of variables as names that point to values, not boxes holding data. 

---

## Naming Rules to Remember 
When naming variables: 
- Use letters, numbers, and underscores --> `user_name`, `score_1`
- Don't start with a number --> `1_message`
- No spaces --> use underscores instead 
- Avoid reserved words like `print` or `for`
- Keep names short but descriptive --> `student_name` is better than `s_n` 
- Be careful: lowercase `l` and uppercase `O` can look like 1 and 0. 

---

## Name and Syntax 

A small typo can cause a big error:

```python
message = "Hello!"
print(mesage) # NameError: name 'mesage' is not defined 
```
When this happens, Python gives a traceback. It tells you the file name, line number, and what went wrong. 

Learning to read these quickly will save tons of time. 

---

## Strings: Working w/ Text 

A **string** is a series of characters inside quotes. 

```python
"This is a string." 
'This is also a string.'
```

You can use single or double quotes, whichever is easier. 

---

## f-Strings: Mixing Text and Variables 

**f-strings** make it easy to combine variables with text. 

```python
first_name = "ada" 
last_name = "lovelace"
full_name = f"{first_name} {last_name}"
print(f"Hello, {full_name.title()}!") 
# Output: Hello, Ada Lovelace!
```
The `f` stands for *format*. Python replaces variable names inside `{}` with their values. 

You can also store a full message: 

```python
message = f"Hello, {full_name.title()}!"
print(message)
```

---

## Whitespace: Spaces, Tabs, and New Lines 

Whitespace helps organize output so it's easier to read. 

Use: 
- `\n` --> new line 
- `\t` --> tab 

```python
print("Languages:\n\tPython\n\tC\n\tJavaScript")
# Output: 
# Languages: 
#   Python
#   C 
#   Javascript
```
### Stripping Extra Spaces 
Python treats `'python '` and `'python'` as different strings. 

We can use these methods to remove unwanted spaces: 

```python
favorite = 'python '
print(favorite.rstrip()) # removes right side space
print(favorite.lstrip()) # removes left side space
print(favorite.strip())  # removes both sides 
```
This is useful when cleaning up user input or comparing strings.

---

## Numbers: Integers and Floats 
Integers are whole numbers, floats are decimals.
```python
2 + 3 # 5
3 - 2 # 1
2 * 3 # 6 
3 / 2 # 1.5 
3 ** 2 # 9 (exponent)
```
Python follows normal math rules (PEMDAS): 
```python
2 + 3 * 4 # 14 
(2 + 3) * 4 # 20
```
When dividing two integers, Python gives a float: 
```python
4 / 2 # 2.0 
```

If you mix an integer and a float, you'll always get a float: 
```python 
1 + 2.0 # 3.0 
```
---

## Underscores in Numbers 

You can use underscores to make large numbers easier to read. 
```python
universe_age = 14_000_000_000
print(universe_age) #
```
Python ignores the underscores when running your code, they're just for readability. 

---

## Multiple Assignment 

You can assign multiple variables in a single line: 
```python 
x, y, z, = 0, 0, 0
```
Each variable gets its matching value in order. 
This helps keep your code short and organized. 

--- 

## Constants 

A **constant** is a variable that shouldn't change.
Python doesn't enforce it, but by convention we use ALL CAPS names: 
```python
MAX_CONNECTIONS = 5000
```
This tells other programmers, "Don't modify this value." 

--- 

## Comments: Explaining Your Code 
Comments describe *what* your code does and *why* you wrote it that way. 

They start with a `#`, and Python ignores them completely. 

**Why comments matter**
- they remind you what your code is supposed to do 
- they make your logic clear for others (and future you)
- writing clear, short comments is one of the best habits to build early on

## Philosophy of The Zen of Python 

You can see Python's design philosophy by typing: 
```python
import this 
```
**Some key ideas:** 
- simple is better than complex 
- complex is better than complicated 
- readability counts 
- there should be one, and perferably only one, obvioust way to solve a problem 
- now is better than never 
- don't chase perfection, write code that works first then decide if you want to improve it
